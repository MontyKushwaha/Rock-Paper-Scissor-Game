# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game
This is a mini project using Python.
1-Developed a Python mini-project implementing a Rock Paper Scissor game.
2-Utilized Python features such as random module, input method list, loops, and conditional statements.
3-Implemented a user-computer interaction mechanism with 5 rounds of play.

i.Developed a Python mini-project that simulates the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, incorporating features like the random
module for computer choices, input methods for user interaction,loops for gameplay management, and conditional statements to determine round outcomes.

ii.Utilized Python's core functionalities such as the random module for generating computer moves, input methods to gather user choices, loops to manage the game flow over 5 rounds, andconditional statements to determine winners based on game rules.

iii.Implemented a user-computer interaction mechanism whereplayers engage in 5 rounds of Rock Paper Scissors, ensuring adynamic and interactive gameplay experience through clear
feedback and score tracking after each round.
